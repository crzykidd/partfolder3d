# Release Cut

You are publishing the GitHub release for **v$ARGUMENTS**. Run this ONLY
after:

- `/release-prep $ARGUMENTS` has merged into `main`, and
- the push-to-`main` CI + image-publish workflows are green and `:latest`
  images are in the registry.

Publishing the release triggers the `release: published` workflow, which
builds and pushes the production `:latest`, `:$ARGUMENTS`, and `:<major>`
images. So this step is the point of no return for production images —
verify before tagging.

## Execution rules

- `$ARGUMENTS` SHOULD be bare semver (no `v` prefix). If a leading `v` was
  typed (`v0.3.6`), strip it silently. After stripping, if the value does
  not match `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` exactly, STOP and ask for a valid version.
- The bare value MUST equal the current version in `<VERSION_FILE>` on
  `main`. If it does not, STOP.
- The release tag is `v$ARGUMENTS` (with the `v` prefix — matches the
  existing tag convention and the Docker `type=semver` extraction). Before
  calling `gh`, assert the tag string matches `^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$`
  exactly. If it does not, STOP — never create a malformed tag.
- Do NOT add `Co-authored-by` lines anywhere.
- If any verification step fails, STOP and report. Do not create the tag.

## Step 1 — Verify we are releasing the right commit

1. `git fetch origin` and check out `main`: `git checkout main && git pull`.
2. Confirm the version in `<VERSION_FILE>` equals `$ARGUMENTS`. If not, the
   prep PR is not merged (or the wrong version was passed) — STOP.
3. Confirm the working tree is clean.
4. Confirm `git log` shows the `chore(release): prepare v$ARGUMENTS` commit on
   `main`. If absent, STOP — the PR has not been merged.

## Step 2 — Verify CI is green on main

Use `gh` to confirm the latest runs on `main` for this commit succeeded:

1. `gh run list --branch main --limit 10` and confirm the most recent runs
   for the release commit concluded `success` for BOTH `<MAIN_CI_WORKFLOW>`
   and `<PUBLISH_WORKFLOW>`.
2. If a run is still in progress, tell the user to wait and STOP — do not tag
   a commit whose images may not exist yet.
3. If a run failed, STOP and report which job failed.

## Step 3 — Confirm the version tag does not already exist

`git tag -l "v$ARGUMENTS"` and `gh release view v$ARGUMENTS` — if either
exists, STOP and report. Never overwrite an existing release/tag.

## Step 4 — Assemble the release notes

Extract the `## [$ARGUMENTS] — <date>` section from `CHANGELOG.md` (everything
from that header up to, but not including, the next `## [` header). This is
the release body — the changelog is the single source of truth, matching the
PR description `/release-prep` created.

## Step 5 — Create the release

Write the extracted section to a temp file and pass it via `--notes-file`.
Create an annotated tag on the current `main` HEAD and publish the release in
one step with `gh`:

```
gh release create v$ARGUMENTS \
  --target main \
  --title "v$ARGUMENTS" \
  --notes-file <tmp>
```

Do not try to inline multi-line release notes.

## Step 6 — Verify the production build fired

1. `gh run list --workflow "<PUBLISH_WORKFLOW>" --limit 3` and confirm a run
   triggered by the `release` event for `v$ARGUMENTS` has started or
   succeeded.
2. Report its status.

## Step 7 — Report

Print:

- The release URL.
- The tag created (`v$ARGUMENTS`).
- The status of the production image build.
- A reminder of the expected image tags once the build finishes:
  `<RELEASE_IMAGE_TAGS>` (typically `:latest`, `:$ARGUMENTS`, and
  `:<major>` per the code-checkin-and-pr publishing matrix).

Done — the release is live.
